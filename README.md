# QU-TRAX Algorithm - **Quantum-Inspired Logistics Optimizer**
---

## Project Overview

QU-TRAX is a production-ready, quantum-inspired logistics optimization engine designed to solve complex problems in supply chain management, such as:

- Route optimization (TSP, VRP)  
- Dynamic scheduling and resource allocation  
- Intelligent warehouse and traffic load management  

Leveraging quantum-inspired algorithms like Simulated Annealing and Quantum Collapse techniques, Q-TRAX aims to provide efficient, scalable, and flexible solutions to logistics challenges.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features Developed Till Date

- Modular backend architecture built with Python FastAPI and async workers  
- Dynamic traffic generator module simulating logistics loads and scenarios  
- Redis-based job queue with RQ workers for asynchronous task execution  
- WebSocket support for real-time progress updates on optimization jobs  
- Configurable quantum-inspired simulation algorithm core  
- Support for multiple environment setups (Mac, Windows, Linux) with detailed installation scripts  
- Logging and debugging facilities to trace optimization workflow and worker statuses

## üì• Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+  
- Redis server  
- Git  
- (Optional) Docker

---

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/q-trax.git
cd q-trax
````

---

### 2. Setup Python virtual environment & install dependencies

#### Mac & Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 3. Install and start Redis server

#### Mac (with Homebrew):

```bash
brew install redis
brew services start redis
```

Verify Redis is running:

```bash
redis-cli ping
# Should respond with PONG
```

---

#### Windows:

* Download Redis for Windows from [https://github.com/tporadowski/redis/releases](https://github.com/tporadowski/redis/releases)
* Extract and run `redis-server.exe` manually or install as a service.
* To start manually (in Command Prompt or PowerShell):

```powershell
redis-server
```

Verify Redis is running in another terminal:

```powershell
redis-cli ping
# Should respond with PONG
```

---

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install redis-server
sudo systemctl start redis
sudo systemctl enable redis
```

Verify Redis is running:

```bash
redis-cli ping
# Should respond with PONG
```

---

### 4. Run RQ Worker to process optimization jobs

In a new terminal window, activate your virtual environment and run:

```bash
rq worker qtrax
```

You should see the worker waiting for jobs.

---

### 5. Start the FastAPI backend server

Run:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The API will be available at: `http://localhost:8000`

---

## üß© Basic Usage

* Submit optimization jobs via the API endpoint `/enqueue_dynamic`
* Track job status and progress in real-time using WebSocket `/ws/results/{job_id}`
* The backend asynchronously executes the quantum-inspired simulation algorithm and streams updates until completion

---

## üìÑ Technical Documentation & Use Case

### Use Case: Dynamic Route Optimization

**Scenario:**
A logistics company wants to optimize delivery routes for a fleet of vehicles, minimizing total travel distance while factoring in traffic and warehouse constraints.

**How Q-TRAX Works:**

* The client submits delivery points and constraints to Q-TRAX backend.
* Q-TRAX‚Äôs quantum-inspired algorithm uses simulated annealing and quantum collapse heuristics to explore the solution space.
* The process runs asynchronously, providing real-time progress updates.
* The optimized routing solution is returned for execution, improving logistics efficiency.

---

## üîÆ Future Roadmap

* Integrate PostgreSQL database with pgvector for embedding-based search
* Dockerize components for container-based deployment
* Build a frontend dashboard with interactive visualizations
* Add machine learning-based traffic and demand forecasting
* Extend support for multimodal transport and advanced resource scheduling
