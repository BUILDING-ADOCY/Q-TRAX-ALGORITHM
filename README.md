# Q-TRAX Algorithm

**Quantum-Inspired Logistics Optimizer**  
_A production-ready engine for intelligent route, scheduling, and resource allocation in supply chain and logistics operations._



## ðŸš€ Overview

Q-TRAX leverages quantum-inspired algorithms (Simulated Annealing / Quantum Collapse) for solving complex logistics optimization problems, including but not limited to:
- Route and path optimization (TSP/VRP)
- Dynamic resource allocation
- Scheduling under constraints

The system is modular, fully tested, container-ready, and easy to integrate with modern API-driven architectures.
