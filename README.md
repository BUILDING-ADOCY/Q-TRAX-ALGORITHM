# Q-TRAX Algorithm

**Quantum-Inspired Logistics Optimizer**  
_A production-ready engine for intelligent route planning, resource scheduling, and dynamic allocation across supply chain networks._


## 🧭 Purpose

**Q-TRAX** aims to solve the most challenging logistics optimization problems by mimicking quantum-inspired behavior in a classical computational environment. Inspired by phenomena like *quantum collapse* and *annealing*, it provides a scalable, fast, and highly adaptable system to optimize the entire logistics lifecycle — from warehouse dispatch to last-mile delivery.

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

Q-TRAX is structured into modular services:

- **Routing Engine**: Calculates shortest and most efficient paths using VRP/TSP techniques.
- **Scheduling Core**: Assigns time slots and delivery batches under constraints.
- **Resource Allocator**: Dynamically distributes assets like trucks, containers, or labor units.
- **Collapse Simulator**: Implements a wave function collapse-inspired probabilistic algorithm to resolve conflicts.
- **API Gateway**: Exposes RESTful endpoints for external consumption.
- **Simulation Module**: Generates real-world scenarios for stress testing and validation.

Each module is loosely coupled and communicates through defined interfaces, allowing independent scaling, testing, and upgrades.

---

## 🧠 Algorithmic Approach

We employ hybrid techniques:
- **Simulated Annealing (SA)**: To escape local minima and approach global optimality.
- **Quantum-Inspired Collapse Heuristics**: Custom-designed state transitions inspired by quantum state resolution.
- **Constraint-Based Search**: Incorporating delivery windows, depot capacity, driver shift limits, etc.
- **Heuristic Boosts**: Dijkstra and A* for greedy initialization before global optimization.

A built-in **priority system** dynamically shifts focus from cost to time or efficiency based on use-case-specific weights.
